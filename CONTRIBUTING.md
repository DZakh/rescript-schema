# Contributing

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all of which are valuable. Here's few guidelines that should help you as you prepare your contribution.

## Initial steps

Before you start working on a contribution, create an issue describing what you want to build. It's possible someone else is already working on something similar, or perhaps there is a reason that feature isn't implemented. The maintainers will point you in the right direction.

## Development

The following steps will get you setup to contribute changes to this repo:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone your forked repo: `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/sury.git`
3. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) if not available `npm i -g pnpm@9.0.5`
4. Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies.
5. Run `pnpm test` in `packages/sury` for tests (it builds the entry bundle and compiles the ReScript bindings first). Use `pnpm res` if you want the ReScript compiler in watch mode while editing `S.res`.

The implementation lives in `packages/sury/src/*.ts` (see `CLAUDE.md` for the module layout); `src/S.res` is a thin ReScript bindings module on top of the same runtime.

## Architecture

This section describes the internal architecture of Sury to help with understanding and contributing to the codebase.

### Core Concepts

#### Schema (internal type)

The internal representation of a type schema, containing:

- `tag`: Type identifier (e.g., `stringTag`, `objectTag`, `arrayTag`)
- `decoder`: Builder function for input validation (type checking)
- `encoder`: Builder function for converting from different schema types
- `parser`: Builder function for transformations after decoding (used by `S.shape`, `S.to`)
- `serializer`: Builder function for reverse transformations
- `inputRefiner`: User validations run on the typed input, before the decoder
- `refiner`: User validations run on the assembled output, after the decoder (`S.reverse` swaps `inputRefiner` ↔ `refiner`)
- `to`: Target schema for transformations (set by `S.shape`, `S.to`)
- `from`: Path array indicating where this value comes from in shaped schemas
- `properties`: For object schemas, a dict of field name to schema
- `items`: For array/tuple schemas, an array of item schemas

#### Builder

A builder is a plain function with signature `(input: Val) => Val`. The schema being built is available as `input.e` (`expected` — there is no separate self-schema parameter). Builders generate JavaScript code at compile time by manipulating `val` objects:

```ts
const myBuilder = (input: Val): Val =>
  // `input.e` is this schema; return the output val
  B_next(input, `someTransform(${input.v()})`, input.e, input.e);
```

Encoders take an extra `target` argument (the schema being coerced into): `(input: Val, target: Internal) => Val`.

#### Val (Value)

A compilation-time representation of a value being processed. Key fields:

- `inline`: The generated code expression (e.g., `i["foo"]`, `v0`)
- `var()`: Function to allocate/retrieve a variable name (use when value is referenced multiple times)
- `schema`: The schema of the current value
- `expected`: The schema we're trying to parse/convert into
- `prev`: Link to the previous val in the transform chain (walked by `merge`)
- `codeFromPrev`: Generated statements that produce this val from `prev`, including the `let` declaration of its own value. A non-empty `codeFromPrev` makes the val non-hoistable in `merge`, so a union discriminant can't be lifted above a `let` it reads.
- `hoistedDecls`: `let` declarations hoisted *onto this val* by a descendant whose own segment was already emitted (a field read on its parent, a loop accumulator before its `for`). Populated with `B.hoistDecl(owner, decl)` and emitted by `merge` right after this val's checks — no callback mutating an unrelated val.
- `finalized`: set by `merge` once a val's code is emitted; a late cached-bond materialization re-reads inline instead of hoisting onto it (#240)
- `checks`: `array<check>` of type-narrows and user refiners. A check whose `fail === B.failInvalidType` is a type-narrow that doubles as a union dispatch discriminant. (Invariant: absent iff no checks — never stored as `Some([])`.)
- `isOutput`: `Some(true)` once refiners have run; advanced decoders (object/array/tuple/union/recursive) set it themselves
- `global`: Shared compilation context containing:
  - `embeded`: Array of embedded values (functions, constants) accessible as `e[n]`
  - `varCounter`: Counter for generating unique variable names

### Compilation Flow

When a schema operation is compiled (e.g., `parseOrThrow`), `parse(val)` runs a
loop until the val is fully decoded (`isOutput` is `Some(true)` and there is no
further `.to`). Each iteration:

```
Input Schema
     │
     ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  parse(val) loop — one iteration                             │
│                                                              │
│  if async flag:                                              │
│     - continue the chain inside `.then(...)`                 │
│                                                              │
│  else if val.isOutput (decoded, may still have `.to`):       │
│     - follow `.to`: run `expected.parser` (custom decoder)   │
│       or `refine` onto `.to` (default encoder coercion)      │
│                                                              │
│  else (not yet decoded):                                     │
│     1. Encoder — if `schema !== expected` and an encoder     │
│        exists, coerce between schema types                   │
│     2. Decoder — otherwise narrow to the schema type         │
│        (e.g. `typeof === "string"`) and push `checks`        │
│     3. markOutput — for primitive decoders, apply            │
│        `inputRefiner`/`refiner` and set `isOutput`           │
│        (advanced decoders own this themselves)               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     │
     ▼
Output Val (chain of `.prev` links)
     │
     ▼
B.merge(output) → JavaScript code string → wrapped into the operation function
```

### Code Generation Example

For `S.object(s => s.field("foo", S.string))` the generated parse function is:

```javascript
i => {
  typeof i === "object" && i || e[1](i); // object validation
  let v0 = i["foo"];                     // field access
  typeof v0 === "string" || e[0](v0);    // string validation
  return v0;                             // return parsed value
};
```

Checks emit as `cond || e[n](x);` (throw when the condition is false), not as
`if (!cond) {...}`. Where:

- `i` is the input argument
- `e` is the embedded values array (error throwers, transformers), accessed as `e[n]`
- `v0`, `v1`, etc. are allocated variables

### Key Functions

- `parse(val)`: Main compilation loop — encoder → decoder → markOutput → follow `.to`, until the val is fully decoded
- `B_merge(val, hoistCond?)`: Walks the `.prev` chain into a code string. With `hoistCond` (union codegen) it lifts type-narrow checks into a dispatch condition; a val with non-empty `codeFromPrev` stays non-hoistable so its `let` travels with the check
- `B_next(prev, code, schema, expected)`: Creates the next val one step down the transform chain
- `B_refine(val, schema?, checks?)`: Clones a val to attach `checks` while preserving the var-allocation link
- `B_hoistDecl(owner, decl)`: Attaches a `let` declaration to a still-open owner val (prev/parent/self) that dominates and outlives the materialized value, replacing the old `allocate` side-channel
- `B_markOutput(val, valInput)`: Applies `inputRefiner`/`refiner` and marks the val as output
- `B_embed(val, value)`: Embeds a runtime value (function, object) and returns a reference like `e[0]`

### Shaped Schemas (S.shape, S.object with definer)

Shaped schemas use a proxy-based approach to track how values are used:

1. During schema definition, field accesses are tracked via `proxifyShapedSchema`
2. Each accessed field gets `from` set to its path (e.g., `["foo"]` for `s.field("foo", ...)`)
3. During parsing, `shapedParser` traverses the target structure and maps values from input
4. During serialization, `shapedSerializer` builds an accumulator (`acc`) that maps output paths to input vals, then `getShapedSerializerOutput` reconstructs the original structure

## Spec Harness Suggestions

A running list of strictness or author-guidance features the spec harness
(`packages/spec`, see the `spec` skill) could add. When working on Sury you hit a
case the harness *should* have caught or guided better — a missing check, a weak
error message, a strictness gap that let a bad spec through — add a bullet here
instead of silently working around it.

- An operation whose output holds a `Blob` or `File` (`S.blob`/`S.file`
  decoding, or the reverse of any conversion into them) can't be specced: the
  golden writer raises "cannot represent a Blob instance as spec source code",
  and an op has no way to opt out. `Uint8Array` is written as a constructor
  call, but a binary container's bytes are only readable asynchronously, so the
  writer would have to await the example before rendering it. It costs a whole
  direction of the content axis: the `codec-*` specs for `S.blob` and `S.file`
  carry codegen and error cases only, and `tests/content_test.ts` holds the
  values instead.
- An example's `error` is matched verbatim, so one raised by the *platform*
  rather than by Sury pins that engine's wording: `new Blob([Symbol()])` says
  "Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string" on Node 22 and "The argument
  'value' is invalid" on Node 24, and the golden passed locally while failing
  CI. Write such an example so the message is ours — an input whose own
  `toString` throws — or the check could compare only the error's constructor
  when the spec says the failure is the platform's.
- `ts.schema` has to evaluate, so a schema whose *construction* panics — every
  argument the public API rejects outright, including the `"pack"`/`"unpack"`
  pairs that don't name two readings — has no spec at all, only a
  `creationError` for the ones that survive construction and fail at the
  operation. `tests/content_test.ts` holds those. A `ts.constructionError`
  beside `creationError` would keep them with the schema they reject.
- `operations` names `parse`, `decode` and `encode` only, so `S.assertInput` and
  `S.inputValidator` have no golden anywhere. Both compile through the same builder chain
  under a different result target, and a change to that target's handling broke
  every `S.assertInput(..., S.json)` and `S.inputValidator(S.jsonString)(...)` call with the whole
  suite green. An `assert` op block, even one holding just an expression and a
  pass/throw example, would have caught it; `tests/content_test.ts` holds it
  instead.
- A spec for a *new* export is timed against a baseline that doesn't have it.
  The expression evaluates to `undefined` there, `S.parser(undefined)` compiles
  to `noopOperation`, and the real validator is then reported as thousands of
  percent slower than a function that returns its input — PR #420 added 14
  formats and got 17 such rows, every one of them bogus. The harness already
  knows how to say `new:` (the same spec's `decode`/`encode` targets are listed
  that way), so `parse` could take the same path when the baseline expression
  is `undefined`, rather than comparing against a no-op. The accompanying
  `behavior changed — baseline accepted it, now rejected` lines have the same
  cause: a no-op accepts every input, valid or not.
