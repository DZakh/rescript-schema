// Typechecks the shipped declarations with `skipLibCheck` OFF.
//
// Every other typecheck in the repo runs with `skipLibCheck: true` (tsconfig.json,
// and most consumers do the same), which does not check .d.ts files at all. A
// broken reference inside index.d.ts therefore raises nothing - it resolves to an
// error type, and everything built on it degrades quietly: a dangling
// `StandardSchemaV1.Props` in `Schema["~standard"]` costs every schema its
// inferred Input and Output while the suite stays green.
//
// This bites specifically when declarations are split across files, since
// `export * from "./other.js"` re-exports names to consumers without binding
// them locally - the file still needs its own `import type`.
