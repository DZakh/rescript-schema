// `S.union` — the factory, the decoder that dispatches a value to one member,

// states which conversions are legal.
//
// The decoder is four stages, each taking the previous one's output:
// source flags (what the source can be) → `unionAnalyze` (one record of
// integers per variant) → `unionPlan` (an ordered list of groups, each sharing
// one type narrow) → `unionEmit` (the dispatch chain). Ordering is by
// specificity rather than source order, which is what puts an instance ahead of
// an earlier generic `object`, and an exact `NaN` ahead of `number`.
//
// Which member a value reaches is invisible in a golden until someone writes the
// spec for exactly that permutation. `pnpm --filter=sury fuzz:union` compares
// this compiler to a sequential try of each variant's own parser/encoder.
