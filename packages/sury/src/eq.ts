// The one invariant the emit must never break is reflexivity: `f(x, x)` is true
// for every value the side admits. NaN is the whole difficulty. It is the only
// value not `===` itself, so every position that can hold one compares with
// SameValueZero instead, and every position that cannot (the default number
