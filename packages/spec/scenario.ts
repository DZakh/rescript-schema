// How a scenario becomes something runnable - shared by benchChild.ts (which
// measures) and harness.ts (which gates), so what passes `spec check` is
// exactly what the measurement can build. Source arrives type-stripped, same
// contract as Target.schemaSrc: benchChild has no TypeScript to strip with.

// One `new Function` per scenario, like every other runner: closures created
// at a shared site can share a feedback vector, making the measured call
// megamorphic. The loop runs once before being handed back, so a version that
// can't execute the scenario fails here - reportable as "new" - rather than
// mid-measurement.
//
// Harness identifiers are `__`-prefixed because `prepare` shares their scope:
// a scenario binding `box` or `run` via `var`/`function` would silently
// disconnect the sink that keeps the JIT from dead-code-eliminating the
// measured expression. `S` stays unprefixed - it is the scenario's contract.
