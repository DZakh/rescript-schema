# ReScript Schema 🧬

The fastest parser in the entire JavaScript ecosystem with a focus on small bundle size and top-notch DX.

> ⚠️ Be aware that **rescript-schema** uses `eval` for parsing. It's usually fine but might not work in some environments like Cloudflare Workers or third-party scripts used on pages with the [script-src](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) header.

Highlights:

- Works with plain JavaScript, TypeScript, and ReScript. You don't need to use any compiler.
- The **fastest** parsing and validation library in the entire JavaScript ecosystem ([benchmark](https://moltar.github.io/typescript-runtime-type-benchmarks/))
- Small JS footprint & tree-shakable API ([Comparison with Zod and Valibot](#comparison))
- Implements the [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) spec
- Declarative transformations in a schema without a performance loss
- Reverse schema and convert values to the initial format (serializing)
- Detailed and easy to understand error messages
- Support for asynchronous transformations
- Immutable API with 100+ different operation combinations
- Easy to create _recursive_ schema
- Opt-in strict mode for object schema to prevent unknown fields with ability to change it for the whole project
- Opt-in ReScript Schema codegen from type definition (ppx)

Also, you can use **rescript-schema** as a building block for your tools. And there are many existing ones:

- [rescript-rest](https://github.com/DZakh/rescript-rest) - RPC-like client, contract, and server implementation for a pure REST API
- [rescript-envsafe](https://github.com/DZakh/rescript-envsafe) - Makes sure you don't accidentally deploy apps with missing or invalid environment variables
- [rescript-json-schema](https://github.com/DZakh/rescript-json-schema) - Typesafe JSON schema for ReScript
- [rescript-stripe](https://github.com/enviodev/rescript-stripe) - Describe and manage Stripe billing in a declarative way with code
- Internal form library at [Carla](https://www.carla.se/)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), [TanStack Form](https://tanstack.com/form), [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router), [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and 15+ more using [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) spec

## Comparison

Instead of relying on a few large functions with many methods, **rescript-schema** follows [Valibot](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot)'s approach, where API design and source code is based on many small and independent functions, each with just a single task. This modular design has several advantages.

For example, this allows a bundler to use the import statements to remove code that is not needed. This way, only the code that is actually used gets into your production build. This can reduce the bundle size by up to 2 times compared to [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

Besides the individual bundle size, the overall size of the library is also significantly smaller.

At the same time **rescript-schema** is the fastest composable validation library in the entire JavaScript ecosystem. This is achieved because of the JIT approach when an ultra optimized validator is created using `eval`.
